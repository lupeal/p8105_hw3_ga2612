``` r

instacart <- instacart %>% as_tibble()
```

The instacart dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables/columns.
Each row in this dataset represents a single product ordered through
instacart. Variables of this dataset include order, product, and user
IDs. Additionally, there are variables corresponding to the order in
which product was added to cart, the time of order, days since prior
order. There are also variables that describe the product, including
product name (i.e. Yogurt, Milk, Water), the aisle (i.e. yogurt, fresh
vegetables) and department (i.e. dairy eggs, produce) where it is
located and the corresponding aisle and department IDs.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

There are a total of 134 aisles with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
being the ones ordered most from. Above is a chart summarizing all
aisles with the number of products ordered per aisle.

Below is a plot that shows the number of items ordered per aisle, for
aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. The aisles are displayed in
an ascending order, by number of items ordered per aisle.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('Number of items ordered per aisle') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The table below shows the three most popular items in aisles “baking
ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. We can
also see the number of times each product was ordered.

``` r
instacart %>%  
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%

  #min_rank gives rank to each tie (btwn each filtering condition)
  #& we're going based on the highest n in each

Below is a table that displays the average hour of the day at which Pink
Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.
Based on the table, we can see that Pink Lady Apples tend to be ordered
earlier in the day compared to Coffee Ice Cream. Day 5 is the exception,
where they were on average ordered in the same hour of that day.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(avg_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow,
              values_from = avg_hour_of_day) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

The table below shows the different states that were observed at 7 or
more locations in 2002. We can see that Connecticut, Florida,
Massachusetts, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; a total of
6 states were observed at 7 or more locations in 2002.

The table below shoes the different states that were observed at 7 or
more location in 2010. We can see that 10 states were observed at 7 or
more locations in 2010; including California, Colorado, Florida,
Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio. Overtime, more states were observed at more locations.

Below are plots for distributions of data value for responses among
location in NY in 2006 and 2010. Based on the plots, we can see that
there were more lower data values for ‘poor’ responses in 2010 than
2006.

Below is a table for the number of men and women in each education
category. We can see that when participants had less than high school
and more than high school education, there were more females than males
in both types of education.

``` r
#table for sex & education count
nhanes_demo %>%
  group_by(education, sex) %>%
  count(sex) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = education,
              values_from = n) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex    | high school equivalent | less than high school | more than high school |
| :----- | ---------------------: | --------------------: | --------------------: |
| female |                     23 |                    28 |                    59 |
| male   |                     36 |                    27 |                    56 |

Below is a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in
each education category. We can see that when participants had more than
high school education, they tend to be younger than the participants
with less than or a high school equivalent education.

``` r
nhanes_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(~education) +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

``` r
#another option for color
# scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'PuRd') 
```

Below are plots for total activities across age for men and women in
different education levels. From the plots we can see that for those
with high school equivalent education total activity tended to decline
for both male and females as age increased. For those with more than
high school education, total activity tended to be higher for younger
males than older males; for females there was higher total activity for
middle-aged women.

``` r
#finally? might work, but feeling iffy on total activity observations. 
nhanes_tidy %>%
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(mims)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1) +
  facet_grid(~education) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Paired') +
  ylab('total activity') +
  ggtitle('total activity across age by education level & sex')
```

![](p8105_hw3_ga2612_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
nhanes_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = mims, color = sex)) +

  facet_grid(~education) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ylab('activity') +
  ggtitle('24hr activity time courses by education level & sex')
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_ga2612_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

The plot above shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each
education level and sex. If we consider minute 0 to be 12am, for all
education levels there is a dip in activity after minute 0 and sometime
after minute 250 - we can attribute it to sleep. For those with more
than high school education, there appears to be higher levels of
activity for females than males; activity levels tend to be evenly
distributed through the day and dip around minute 1250.
